        <h3>About Myself</h3>
        <p>Hello, thanks for visiting! I am a full-stack developer in training, and I am currently enrolled in the EdX / UCLA coding bootcamp.  I am also employed as an insurance agent, and prior to this I was a K-8 music teacher and a private guitar teacher.  So far I have learned HTML and CSS, and have begun learning Javascript.  I am enjoying what I am learning so far, and am excited to continue down this journey! Thanks again for visiting my portfolio!</p>
